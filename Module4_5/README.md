This code was written to control Puppeteer, an interactive, kinetic art piece by Sophia DeVito. Attach the ESP32 embedded in the structure to a computer through a USB cord, and upload the arduino file entitled hand_servo_code. This code controls the five servos on the rig, and the entire piece is powered by a laptop.

Once the code is uploaded, the piece can be experienced by having partipants slide the fingers of their right hand, palm down, into the five loops. They should then relax their hand, and allow the robot to take on full control.
