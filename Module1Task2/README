"Colorful Moonscape" is a generative art peice created by Sophia DeVito and designed to be 
displayed on the 6 projectors located in the Yale CCAM Leeds studio. It is written in 
Processing, and as the moon moves across each projector, the sky and the hills randomly
generate a new color combination, creating an otherworldly effect.

To run this program, download the colorful moonscape.zip file from github onto the CCAM 
Leeds Studio computer. Unzip it, and run the application entitled sketch_210920a.pde. 
This should open the window across both virtual desktops, and no other input is necessary.
