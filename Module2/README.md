This code is written for an interactive device created by Sophia DeVito. Main.py is meant to be run on a Raspberry Pi, which is connected to an Arduino ESP32 through a USB. The ESP32 is meant to be encoded with ESP32SerialWrite.ino, and should have a joystick, button, and switch connected to the correct pins. Once this code has been loaded, the Raspberry Pi should output sounds through headphones connected to its headphone jack. Playing with the three input devices connected to the ESP32 will effect the audio output.

The user of this device should put on the headphones, close their eyes, and imagine themselves transported. By moving the joystick and toggling the switch, you can interact with your new environment. By pressing the button, you will be transported to another scene.
